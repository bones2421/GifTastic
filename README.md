Gif Tastic
is a simple app where the user gets to pull up gifs and add buttons based on search criteria. It pulls from the giphy API to provide these results. This is a front-end, visually pleasing app. Though it is simple, I am proud of it!

Getting Started
To run this all you have to do go to the live site that is linked. No installing, no console. This just runs in the browser.

Prerequisites
Your web browser and the deployed link

This app is very user friendly and can be run easily. This would be great to show basic front-end skills or to show how API's work.

This app is quite easy to deploy. You only need to have access to the repository and you just need to create a live link from the settings page of github.
